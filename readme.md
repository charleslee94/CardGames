## Card Game Project

The object of this project is to emulate a deck of cards to play a suite of simple card games
The list currently includes:
memory matching game (done)
blackjack (not started)
Solitaire (started)

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with python, some things including basic linting/styles (WIP), directory structure and the like, as well as to be a quick refresher in various OOP paradigms.

This readme will become more updated as time goes on.
